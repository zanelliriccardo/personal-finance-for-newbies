    Personal Finance for Newbies (or PFN) is a web app that ‚Äì from buy/sell
    financial asset transactions ‚Äì provides easy-to-use, near-real-time statistics
    (*i.e.*, updated to the last closing) on your investment portfolio.
    <br><br>
    PFN allows you to analyse your portfolio from multiple perspectives:
    from higher-level metrics (profit & loss, asset class weights) to those
    allowing you to study risk and returns in depth, especially over time.
    To use the app, you don't need to create an account! You just need to set up a file
    (see the template below) containing your buy/sell transactions. PFN takes care of
    downloading historical prices from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
    and analysing them for you.
    <br><br>
    We do not collect or store any data. Nor do we provide any guarantee of the accuracy
    of the results displayed, which are intended for educational and informational
    purposes only. The project is open source and we always look for pull requests,
    if you know better!
